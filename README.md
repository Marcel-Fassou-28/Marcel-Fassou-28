# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcel Fassou Haba

🎓 First-year **Computer Engineering** student at the **National School of Applied Sciences of El Jadida (ENSAJ)**.  
💡 Passionate about **computer science**, **emerging technologies**, and **cybersecurity**, I fully commit to every project to grow both technically and personally.

👨‍💻 My goal is to become a **versatile engineer**, capable of designing efficient software solutions, adapting to various technological environments, and contributing to high-impact projects.  
I’m driven by **curiosity**, a strong **sense of initiative**, and a passion for **quality work**—values that I apply to everything I do.

📈 Alongside my academic journey, I spend time strengthening my **full-stack development** skills, exploring the foundations of **emerging technologies** such as **Artificial Intelligence**, and understanding the **challenges of cybersecurity**.
